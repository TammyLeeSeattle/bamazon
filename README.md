# UW Week 12 Homework:
## Node.js & MySQL â€” "Bamazon"

## Overview

**From the Assignment:**

*Description:* In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

*BONUS:* You can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
